# DXOS

> DXOS is an Operating System for Decentralized Software.

DXOS is a collection of several technologies:

- **Local consensus:** state synchronization under real-time multiple writers and latent offline writers between a group of peers (`ECHO`)
- **Peer networking:** peer discovery, NAT traversal (`MESH`)
- **Infrastructure:** where to deploy and host to make your code available to the network (`KUBE`)
- **Identity:** decentralized, private, secure, convenient identity (`HALO`)
