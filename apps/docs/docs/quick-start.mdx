## Using an ECHO database for state consensus
Install the ECHO client with your package manager of choice
```bash
> npm install --save @dxos/echo
```
or include via CDN:
```html
<script src="https://jsdelivr..."/>
```

Create an ECHO instance either in browser or on the server:
```ts
import { Client } from "@dxos/echo"

const client = new Client();
```
See here for the [configuration options](/config) you can pass in.

Create a space and query items:
```ts
const space = client.spaces.createSpace();
const items = await space.getItems();
```
Read more in the [ECHO overview](/docs/echo/overview) and [how ECHO works](/docs/echo/how-echo-works).

## Creating apps
The `dx` cli offers a production-ready application template for building **local-first applications** with ECHO. The template is made of `vite`, `typescript`, `react`, `echo`, `pwa`, and other opinions. Read more about the [hello world template](https://) and the [bare template](https://).

Using your favorite package manager of choice like `npm`, `yarn`, or `pnpm`:
```bash
> npm i -g @dxos/cli 
```
Now you can use the `dx` command line tool:
```bash
> dx apps create hello # or with --template=bare
> cd hello
> npm run dev
```
This will start the development server in the new application.

## Building your app for production
```bash
> npm build
```
This will produce a `dist` folder with an entry point and a `dist/README.md`

## Starting a KUBE node
Runnig a [KUBE](https://) gives you superpowers. Installation:
```bash
> sudo ch=dev bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://dxos.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/install.sh)"
```
Then:
```bash
> kube start # start the service in the background
> open localhost:9000 # open the browser to the console
```
